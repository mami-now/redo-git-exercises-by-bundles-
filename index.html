  <h1> I love coding</h1>
  <p>

    In the realm of lines and loops, we play,
    Where ideas and logic have their say,
    In the world of coding, we find delight,
    Creating wonders, day and night.
    
    With syntax sweet, we weave our dreams,
    In pixels and bytes, our passion gleams,
    Algorithms dance, elegant and bright,
    Solving puzzles with sheer delight.
    
    Like a painter with a canvas vast,
    Code transforms, the future it casts,
    Bugs may lurk, but we'll persevere,
    For coding's joy, nothing to compare.
    
    From "Hello, World" to the grand design,
    The journey's thrilling, truly divine,
    In this realm of wonders, we explore,
    Coding's fun, forevermore.git
